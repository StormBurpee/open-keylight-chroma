# Development record

## 2026-10-07 — independent firmware begins

The preceding private hardware investigation demonstrated application OTA, RGB/white control and bounded smooth transitions in an additive stock application. That is evidence about the interface, not evidence that this independent firmware boots.

This repository starts with original implementation source only. The owner selected the name Open Keylight Chroma and explicitly requested replacement applications for both ESP32 and NXP. ESP bring-up retains protocol compatibility temporarily; an independent NXP implementation is part of the target. No vendor images, device credentials, private network traces or decompiler exports belong in this tree.

Work in progress: portable protocol driver and fault tests; ESP-IDF boot/migration compatibility; authenticated API and state model; embedded dashboard. Public installation is not yet qualified. Release claims will be tied to a reproducible test record.

Decisions: preserve the installed flash layout; pin ESP-IDF 5.5.5; cap an application at 1,572,864 bytes; single SPI owner; no NVS erase fallback; preserve output on connection loss; MQTT discovery for Home Assistant; audio deferred.
